# sub_finder
While penetration testing or bug hunting is being conducted, it's so important to gather as much information as possible, and finding subdomains is really important as well. Finding subdomains could help understanding the infrastrture of the web application, and find any possible vulnerbalities in other subdomains while the main domain could be much more protected. So here is a tool that could be useful in finding subdomains, the tool is built with python and in order for the script to start running, the attacker should provide two things:
1) Subdomain Wordlist.
2) Domain Name. 

### Usage: python3 sub_finder.py
